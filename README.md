# Setting-a-Goal-and-a-Budget
To market your business right, you need to set a goal. What is your vision and endgame for your business?

The primary SMB marketing strategy is to set the right goal and a reasonable budget.

What do you really want to happen? Are you looking to expand your companyâ€™s reach, or do you want to strengthen your hold on the local market? Do you want people to become aware of your brand?

All these are valid goals, of course. But as you set the goal or goals that you want to accomplish, you also need to think about your budget.

Your budget needs to be in sync with what your goals are. At the same time, it needs to be realistic and practical.

The thing is, your goals will not be relegated to just one or two. It is likely that you have several. To avoid confusion and to make it easier to track your growth, you have to prioritize your goals.

Which goal matches your most pressing need? Identify that and focus on it first.

Then you can set your sights on the long-term goals that you consider to be the most important for your business.
